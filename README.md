# üéì InsightFlowEdu  
*A Data-Driven Academic Insight and Intervention Platform*

---

## üåü Overview
**InsightFlowEdu** is a mini-project developed as part of **Software Engineering** and **DBMS** coursework.  
It‚Äôs an integrated academic analytics platform that helps faculty identify at-risk students early through data-driven insights on performance, attendance, and feedback sentiment.

The project demonstrates:
- **Software Engineering principles** ‚Äî SRS, class & sequence diagrams, use cases, and modular design.
- **DBMS skills** ‚Äî Oracle database design, ER modeling, PL/SQL procedures, triggers, and Java database connectivity.

## üß© Key Features
- **Student Performance Tracking:** Records and analyzes GPA and attendance trends per semester.
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** PL/SQL procedure flags students below academic thresholds.
- **Feedback Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies student feedback as *positive*, *neutral*, or *negative* using a simple keyword-based PL/SQL function.
- **Intervention Logs:** Faculty can record and review intervention notes per student.
- **Dashboard UI:** Clean React-based interface for analytics, charts, and insights.
